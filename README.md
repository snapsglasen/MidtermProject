## How Inside Scoop Works:

  A user will be presented with a homepage, prompting them to either register an account with the site, or to sign in using a registered account. Once signed in, a page welcoming the user by their username and registered first name will show along with the universal navbar at the top with links for viewing other user profiles, quiz questions, posts recently made, posts with the highest user ratings, as well as a logout option.
  When the user profiles section is clicked on, one can search for a user profile from a text box using a keyword. The result will be a list of profiles containing said keyword appearing in a modal; if no keyword is used, the list will contain all registered users.
  If the questions link is chosen, a text box search will allow the user to find a question by keyword and having button options for random quiz viewing as well as for the user to create their own question, while listing all questions by title and user following.
  Once a question is chosen, the user can tick multiple choice answer boxes and submit to see if they were right or wrong; the answer page will allow the user to see if they were correct, how many attempts they made at the question, and can up or down vote the question itself.
  Both the "recent posts" and "popular posts" have the same layout and options with the only difference being their main pages listing all posts' name and title by their dates created or how many upvotes received. Both pages have a search text box that utilizes a keyword, followed by button options that sort
  by choice of title, oldest, newest, or popularity, with a button option to create a new post at the bottom of the page. Once a post is clicked on, the user can view the text and properties of a post, such as its category in programming or the creator's company. The user can comment on posts as well as vote positively or negatively on either post or related comments.
  A user can only delete or update their own posts, comments, or questions; however, an admin class of user can perform all CRUD operations on any given part of this site.

  Through this project, I finally have a full grasp on what wiring code through a controller via DAOs and JSPs; until now, this had been extraordinarily confusing. Also, seeing how multiple DAOs and Controllers can be used to segregate code and make it more readable/manageable.
