## How Inside Scoop Works:

  A user will be presented with a homepage, prompting them to either register an account with the site, or to sign in using a registered account. Once signed in, a page welcoming the user by their username and registered first name will show along with the universal navbar at the top with links for viewing other user profiles, quiz questions, posts recently made, posts with the highest user ratings, as well as a logout option.
  When the user profiles section is clicked on, one can search for a user profile from a text box using a keyword. The result will be a list of profiles containing said keyword appearing in a modal; if no keyword is used, the list will contain all registered users.
  If the questions link is chosen, a text box search will allow the user to find a question by keyword and having button options for random quiz viewing as well as for the user to create their own question, while listing all questions by title and user following.
  Once a question is chosen, the user can tick multiple choice answer boxes and submit to see if they were right or wrong; the answer page will allow the user to see if they were correct, how many attempts they made at the question, and can up or down vote the question itself.
  Both the "recent posts" and "popular posts" have the same layout and options with the only difference being their main pages listing all posts' name and title by their dates created or how many upvotes received. Both pages have a search text box that utilizes a keyword, followed by button options that sort
  by choice of title, oldest, newest, or popularity, with a button option to create a new post at the bottom of the page. Once a post is clicked on, the user can view the text and properties of a post, such as its category in programming or the creator's company. The user can comment on posts as well as vote positively or negatively on either post or related comments.
  A user can only delete or update their own posts, comments, or questions; however, an admin class of user can perform all CRUD operations on any given part of this site.

  ## Tech Used:
  Java, JPA, MySQLWorkbench, SQL, JPQL, JavaScript, HTML, Controllers, DAOs, JSPs, SpringBoot, Git

  ## Lessons Learned:

  # Joe:
  Given the variation of the modern technological environment, it is more and more important to build responsive web applications. In terms of today's tool suite, this means mastering the use of grids and flexboxes in html, css, and a handful of other languages. Beyond that, to create more powerful and functional web applications, we will need to begin to incorporate javascript. I ran up against these themes time and time again while building our project. Moving forward, I intend to place an emphasis on mastering the fundamentals while also adding new, powerful, and interesting tools to my toolbelt. This project also reinforced a growing design sense with beauty, simplicity, and practicality at its core.

  # James:
  One of our mistakes is what taught me the most. Due to the scope of this project we really needed to use a lot of controllers and DAOs but with this being the first project of this magnitude that we have worked on we didn't quite do that and it got a bitt difficult to navigate. There was a ton of fun logic which provided interesting challenges and really understanding how each part works with another. The importance of organization and cooperation is certainly not lost on me.

  # Ryan:
  Through this project, I finally have a full grasp on what wiring code through a controller via DAOs and JSPs; until now, this had been extraordinarily confusing. Also, seeing how multiple DAOs and Controllers can be used to segregate code and make it more readable/manageable.
